## 🧮 Algorithm Patterns Covered

### 1. **Two Pointers & Sliding Window**
- **Two Sum** - Find pairs that sum to target
- **Sliding Window** - Maximum sum subarray, longest substring without repeats
- **Fast & Slow Pointers** - Cycle detection, middle element finding

### 2. **Sorting & Search**
- **Binary Search** - Standard and variants (first/last occurrence, rotated array)
- **Sorting Patterns** - Multiple sorting algorithms and sorting-based problems
- **Top K Elements** - Heap-based solutions for frequent elements

### 3. **Graph & Tree Problems**
- **Course Schedule** - Topological sorting for course prerequisites
- **Meeting Rooms** - Interval scheduling and room allocation

### 4. **Dynamic Programming & Greedy**
- **Greedy Algorithms** - Activity selection, jump game, gas station
- **Interval Problems** - Merge intervals, meeting room scheduling

### 5. **Array & String Manipulation**
- **Prefix Sum** - Range queries, subarray sum problems
- **Merge Operations** - Merge K sorted lists, merge intervals
